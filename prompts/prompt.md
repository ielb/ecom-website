## Overview

I'm developing a comprehensive prompt for an AI engineer who will be assisting with expanding our e-commerce platform. The existing codebase has a solid foundation with core shopping, user management, and UI elements, but we need to implement several critical missing components to complete the platform.

## Project Background

We've built a Next.js-based e-commerce website with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components that includes:

- Product browsing and detail pages with variants and image galleries
- Cart functionality with mini-cart
- Basic checkout flow
- Authentication system with Zustand state management
- Wishlist functionality
- Responsive design with modern UI components

## Technical Requirements

I need you to help implement the following key missing components:

### 1. User Account Section

Develop a complete user account area with:

- Profile management page
- Address book functionality
- Order history with detailed views
- Password reset flow
- Account settings and preferences

### 2. Enhanced Shopping Experience

Create dedicated pages for:

- Full wishlist management
- Category browsing with filtering and sorting
- Collections/featured products showcase
- Sale/discount items section
- Product comparison functionality

### 3. Improved Checkout Process

Implement:

- Multi-step checkout with progress indicators
- Order confirmation page with summary
- Order tracking system
- Saved payment methods management

### 4. Store Information Architecture

Design and implement:

- About Us page
- Contact form with validation
- FAQ system with search capability
- Privacy policy and terms pages
- Shipping and returns information

### 5. Additional Features

If time permits, please suggest implementation approaches for:

- Blog/content marketing integration
- Customer reviews system
- Gift card functionality
- Size guide integration
- Newsletter subscription system

## Technical Constraints

- Continue using Next.js App Router
- Maintain TypeScript throughout
- Extend the existing Zustand stores for state management
- Follow established component architecture
- Ensure mobile responsiveness across all new pages

## Deliverables Expected

1. Code implementations for the requested pages
2. Component documentation
3. State management approach for new features
4. Suggestions for API endpoints needed
5. Performance considerations for the expanded site

Can you provide a detailed implementation plan for these missing components, with priority recommendations and technical considerations specific to our Next.js/TypeScript architecture?
